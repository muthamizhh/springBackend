Hi Team,
As I wrap up my internship today, I just wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you. It’s been a truly memorable and enriching experience working with this amazing team. Even though we were miles apart, I never once felt the distance—thanks to the warmth, support, and constant encouragement I received from all of you. You made it incredibly easy for me to reach out, ask questions, and feel like part of the team from day one.
A special thanks to Vishal and Shreya—your guidance has been instrumental in shaping my internship journey.
Vishal, interacting with you often reminded me of my school days, especially my 10th-grade literature classes. The way you articulate thoughts and drop literary references—be it Shakespeare or other poets—was both nostalgic and inspiring. I’ve genuinely picked up a number of new phrases and expressions from you, and it’s been a delight learning from you, not just professionally, but linguistically as well!
Shreya, you’ve been my go-to person throughout. I can’t thank you enough for your patience, your clarity in explaining things, and your ever-helpful attitude. Whether it was a technical doubt or figuring out who to reach out to for a specific issue, you were always approachable and spot-on with your guidance. I truly appreciate how approachable and supportive you’ve been every step of the way.
To Sonika, Madhu, and Puneeth—it was a pleasure working with you all. Your experience and insights have been incredibly valuable, and I’ve learned a great deal just by observing and interacting with you.
And Surendra, thank you for being such an amazing Scrum Master. Your energy, coordination, and leadership made working in this agile environment seamless and fun. I feel fortunate to have had someone like you facilitating our work and keeping everything running so smoothly.
Once again, thank you all for making this internship a genuinely fulfilling and enjoyable chapter of my career. I look forward to staying connected and hopefully crossing paths again in the future.
Wishing you all continued success!
Warm regards,

Vishal, our interactions often took me back to my school days, particularly my 10th-grade literature classes. The way you express ideas and weave in literary references—whether from Shakespeare or other classic writers—added a unique charm to our conversations. I've quietly picked up quite a few new phrases and expressions from you along the way. It’s been a pleasure learning from you, both professionally and through those thoughtful exchanges.
